<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

In 2014, the Google Chrome dev team released T-Rex Jump as a hidden easter egg.
If a user's computer couldn't connect to the internet, a message with a little
dino would pop up. Pressing space would initialize the game, where players
had to make the dino jump over incoming obstacles, mainly cacti and pterodactyls.

In this tutorial, we'll try to build this well known game using the p5.js drawing
library. It's simple API will allow us to build the game quickly without having
to worry about the quirks of the HTML5 canvas 2D renderer.

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

Lets start by clicking [HERE](https://repl.it/@rlx310/P5-Boilerplate)
to open our starter project. You'll want to click the Fork button to
make a copy of the project that you can edit yourself. Refresh after
you fork so that the preview window syncs up with your version of the
project. Feel free to sign-in/sign-up as well!

  We'll want to open the sketch.js file since that's where we're going to be
  writting all of our code.

<h3 id="first-steps">First Steps</h3>

Lets quickly make sure that all the files in our project are working properlly.
Lets add some code to our **setup** and **draw** functions.

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight)
}

function draw() {
  background('#333')
}
```

The code above should draw a grey background onto your screen. Feel free to
modify the color using a HEX color from a [color picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker).

Once you've picked your color, we should be good to move onto drawing our player!
