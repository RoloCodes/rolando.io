<h3 id="class">Obstacles Class</h3>

We were able to get away with using plain objects for our dino and our horizon
because only one of them exist at a time. But we need to be able to generate
mulitiple obstacles. We'll be using **classes** in JavaScript to create a
template for our obstacles. Write this near your globals, ideally under your
dino object.

```js
class Obstacle {
  constructor(x, width, height, color, speed) {
    this.x = x
    this.y = horizon.y - height
    this.width = width
    this.height = height
    this.color = color
    this.speed = speed
    this.onScreen = true
  }
}
```

Like our dino, we'll want it to line up with the horizon. We also want to
be able to customize the width, height, and color to be able to create
differnt types of obstacles later on.

Now we need to be able to draw our obstacle
onto our screen, so lets add a **draw** method directly to our class.

```js {12-17}
class Obstacle {
  constructor(x, width, height, color, speed) {
    this.x = x
    this.y = horizon.y - height
    this.width = width
    this.height = height
    this.color = color
    this.speed = speed
    this.onScreen = true
  }

  draw() {
    fill(this.color)
    stroke('#fff')
    strokeWeight(2)
    rect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height)
  }
}
```

This is honeslty much more organized than our other objects, since
we're encapsulating the functionality of our obstacles in our class
as well. Feel free to update you game so that your **drawDino**
and **drawHorizon** are also saved as methods for our
**dino** and **horizon** objects.

For now though, we'll move on to finally drawing an obstacle. Since we
plan on having multiple obstacles, lets create an array after our **Obstacle**
class to help us keep a list of these obstacles.

```js
// list of obstacles
let obstacles = []
```

Then, in our **setup** function, lets add a new obstacle to this list.

```js {3}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight)
  obstacles.push(new Obstacle(500, 50, 50, 'red', 5))
}
```

And finally, in our **update**, lets actually draw the obstacle

```js {5}
function draw() {
  background('#333')
  drawDino()
  drawHorizon()
  obstacles[0].draw()
}
```

You should now see this on your screen.

Now that our obstacle has shown up, lets get it to move! We'll need to go back
to our **Obstacle** class and add an **update** method.

```js {19-28}
class Obstacle {
  constructor(x, width, height, color, speed) {
    this.x = x
    this.y = horizon.y - height
    this.width = width
    this.height = height
    this.color = color
    this.speed = speed
    this.onScreen = true
  }

  draw() {
    fill(this.color)
    stroke('#fff')
    strokeWeight(2)
    rect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height)
  }

  update() {
    this.onScreen = this.x > -this.width
    this.x -= this.speed
  }
}
```

We kill two birds with one stone here by updating the **x** position
of our obstacle, and checking if its still on the screen so we can
remove it later to save memory.

Lets now make another update to our draw function so that it starts
moving the obstacle

```js {6}
function draw() {
  background('#333')
  drawDino()
  drawHorizon()
  obstacles[0].draw()
  obstacles[0].update()
}
```

<h3 id="multuiple">Multuple Obstacles</h3>

We have one obstacle spawning, now lets make it so that mupltiple spawn! Lets populate
our obstacle array with a few more obstacles.

```js {3}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight)
  obstacles.push(
    new Obstacle(500, 50, 50, 'red', 5),
    new Obstacle(1000, 50, 50, 'yellow', 5)
  )
}
```

Right now, our game only tries to draw the first obstacle, so lets fix that
by creating a function that loops through all our obstacles and draws them!
Create the **handleObstacles** function lets use it to loop through our obstacles.

```js
function handleObstacles() {
  for (let i = obstacles.length - 1; i >= 0; i -= 1) {
    let obstacle = obstacles[i]

    obstacle.update()
    obstacle.draw()

    if (!obstacle.onScreen) {
      obstacles.splice(i, 1)
    }
  }
}
```

Our function uses a traditional for loop to go through all our obstacles
and draw them, except it loops backwards. This is because our new obstacles
are getting added to the end of the array, and get removed from the beginning
of the array. During a frame that removes an obstacle, if we looped from the
beginning, we would end up skipping one of our obstacles for one frame, which
is a subtle but noticable glitch.

Now we need to update our draw function to actually use **handleObstacles**

```js {5}
function draw() {
  background('#333')
  drawDino()
  drawHorizon()
  handleObstacles()
}
```

Multuple obstacles should be spawning now. This is great. Lets take it further
by dynamically spawning more obstacles. Lets start by making the **createObstacles**
function, which will create a new obstacle and add it to our list of obstacles.
We'll also need to create a function that periodically spawns a new obstacle. Lets
call this **handleLevel**.

```js
function createObstacle() {
  obstacles.push(new Obstacle(canvasWidth, 50, 50, 'red', 5))
}

function handleLevel(frameCount) {
  const interval = 45
  if (frameCount % interval === 0) {
    let smoothRandom = noise(frameCount)

    if (smoothRandom < frequency) {
      createObstacle()
    }
  }
}
```

In the **handleLevel** function, we set a timing interval that correlates to how many
frames we want to occur before we to try spawning a new obstacle. In the code above,
we set it so that our obstales spawn every 45 frames. Since our games will most likely
run at 60 frames per second, our obstacles will spawn every 0.75 seconds.

**SmoothRandom** generates a random number between 0 and 1 (so a decimal), similar to how JavaScript
normally handles random numbers, except it uses the **noise** function. Noise limits
how far random numbers are from each other, causing a smoother and more natural transition
between random numbers. It makes it so that our game will spawn our obstacles in bursts, as
opossed to abritrarily.

We check our random number against our **frequency** which we should set with our globals.
Frequency lets us set a threshold between 0 and 1 that decides whether or not our new
obstacle should spawn. Lets set that variable now at the top of our code.

```js {4}
// globals
const canvasWidth = 600
const canvasHeight = 200
let frequency = 0.5
```

Last but not least, we need to run the **handleLevel** function in our **draw**.

```js {5}
function draw() {
  background('#333')
  drawDino()
  drawHorizon()
  handleLevel(frameCount)
  handleObstacles()
}
```

Once we've confirmed that we have obstacles spawning periodically. We can remove
the obstacles that we manually created in our **setup**.

```js {3-6}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight)
  // obstacles.push(
  //   new Obstacle(500, 50, 50, 'red', 5),
  //   new Obstacle(1000, 50, 50, 'yellow', 5)
  // )
}
```

And with that, we are ready to move on to the next lesson where we will
make have different types of obstacles, and add a Game Over screen.
