<h3 id="drawing">Drawing the Dino</h3>

Our first step should be to configure the settings we want for our dino. Width,
height, position, and color need to be defined for the dino. Lets add the
following code in our globals section at the top of our file.

```js {5-12}
// globals
const canvasWidth = 600
const canvasHeight = 200

const dino = {
  x: 40,
  y: 100,
  width: 30,
  height: 50,
  innerColor: '#999',
  outerColor: '#fff'
}
```

Lets create a new function called **drawDino**, that lets us draw our dinosaur
onto the screen. We'll want to start by drawing our player as a simple
ellipse, so we can get our game logic working first, before we worry about
adding image sprites, animations, or other cosemtics. Write this function
under both your draw and setup functions.

```js
function drawDino() {
  ellipseMode(CORNER)
  fill(dino.innerColor)
  stroke(dino.outerColor)
  strokeWeight(2)
  ellipse(dino.x, dino.y, dino.width, dino.height)
}
```

The [ellipseMode](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipseMode) function lets
us set the origin of our ellipse to its top-left corner, so our _x_ and _y_
properties map to top-left corner of our player (by default its the center).

The [fill](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill) function allows us to set the
inner color, [stroke](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/stroke) sets the border
color, [strokeWeight](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/strokeWeight) sets the
thickness of the border, and
[ellipse](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse) actually draws our round
player, using the configuration object we created.

We will also need to update our **draw** function so that it actually draws our dinosaur.

```js {3}
function draw() {
  background('#333')
  drawDino()
}
```

At this point your game should look like this:

<h3 id="horizon">Drawing the Horizon</h3>

Now that the dino is on our screen, lets move on to drawing our horizon, or
our floor. Similar to our dino, lets define our horizon in our globals
section and configure it.

```js
const horizon = {
  x: 0,
  y: canvasHeight - 40,
  width: canvasWidth,
  height: 2,
  color: '#fff'
}
```

We want it to span the entire width of our canvas (**canvasWidth**),
as well as be slighly above the bottom (**canvasHeight**). Remember
that the y-axis is reveresed when drawing onto computer screens, which
why we're subtracting 40.

Next, we need to create our **drawHorizon** function at the bottom of
our file.

```js
function drawHorizon() {
  stroke(horizon.color)
  strokeWeight(horizon.height)
  line(horizon.x, horizon.y, horizon.x + horizon.width, horizon.y)
}
```

And finally, we need to call the **drawHorizon** function in our **draw**.

```js {4}
function draw() {
  background('#333')
  drawDino()
  drawHorizon()
}
```

At this point, our game should look similar to this:

<h3 id="jump">Getting Dino to Jump</h3>

We now have enough to actually program our dino to jump! The first thing we'll
want to do is apply a constant downward force to our dino so that it's always
moving towards the ground. This requires that we add a few more properties
to our dino.

```js {8-10}
const dino = {
  x: 40,
  y: 100,
  width: 30,
  height: 50,
  innerColor: '#999',
  outerColor: '#fff',
  yVelocity: 0,
  gravity: 0.8,
  onGround: false
}
```

We'll use the **gravity** property to apply a persistent downward force to our
dino. Once we hit the ground, we don't want to keep moving, so we want
to make our vertical speed (**yVelocity**) a separate property, as well as
use **onGround** so our game can keep track of when the dino is already
touching the floor. We only want to jump when the dino is touching the ground.

Lets now update our **drawDino** function so that it applies our gravity.

```js {2-3}
function drawDino() {
  dino.yVelocity += dino.gravity
  dino.y += dino.yVelocity

  ellipseMode(CORNER)
  fill(dino.innerColor)
  stroke(dino.outerColor)
  strokeWeight(2)
  ellipse(dino.x, dino.y, dino.width, dino.height)
}
```

![Dino falling downwards](/static/pages/javascript/trexgame/dino-falling.gif)

Looks like we're going downwards now, but we're not stopping!
We haven't told our dino to stop moving when he hits the horizon.
Lets add that logic to our **drawDino** function.

```js {2-12}
function drawDino() {
  const bottom = dino.y + dino.height
  const nextBottom = bottom + dino.yVelocity

  if (nextBottom >= horizon.y) {
    dino.yVelocity = 0
    dino.y = horizon.y - dino.height
    dino.onGround = true
  } else if (horizon.y - bottom > 1) {
    dino.yVelocity += dino.gravity
    dino.onGround = false
  }

  dino.y += dino.yVelocity

  ellipseMode(CORNER)
  fill(dino.innerColor)
  stroke(dino.outerColor)
  strokeWeight(2)
  ellipse(dino.x, dino.y, dino.width, dino.height)
}
```

In the code above, we first calculate where the bottom of our dino is,
and where our dino is going to be in the next frame of our game. When
our dino hits the horizon, we set **yVelocity** to zero and no longer
apply our gravity, which stops the dino from moving. But if we haven't
hit the horizon yet, we continue to apply gravity.

The movement for our dino is almost complete, we now need to tell the
dino how to jump. So let us go back to our dino object and teach it
to jump!

```js {12-14}
const dino = {
  x: 40,
  y: 100,
  width: 30,
  height: 50,
  innerColor: '#999',
  outerColor: '#fff',
  yVelocity: 0,
  gravity: 0.8,
  onGround: false,

  jump() {
    this.yVelocity = -12
  }
}
```

When the **jump** function is triggered, we should be able to make our
dino move up. However, we don't have a way to tell the dino to jump yet, so
lets add the [keyPressed](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyPressed) function
under our **draw** function. This function is automatically called by p5.js
whenever we press any key on our keyboard.

```js
function keyPressed() {
  if ((keyCode === 38 || keyCode === 32) && dino.onGround) {
    dino.jump()
  }
}
```

The **keyCode 38** maps to the **Up Arrow** on your keyboard, and the
**keyCode 32** maps to the **spacebar**. Feel free to go [HERE](http://keycode.info/)
and start typing to see what the other keycodes are.

And just like that, you now have a jumping character! In the next lesson, we'll go
over how to add the obstacles we want to jump over.
