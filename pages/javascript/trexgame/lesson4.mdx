<h3 id="pausing">Pausing</h3>

Now to really wrap up our game, we want to actually calculate whether or not
our player and our obstacles overlap. When they do, the game should stop.
We need to set this up first by making our program aware if the game is
paused or not. So lets add a **paused** variable to our game.

```js {5}
// globals
const canvasWidth = 600
const canvasHeight = 200
let frequency = 0.5
let paused = false
```

And make use of the paused variable in our **draw**.

```js {2}
function draw() {
  if (paused) return
  background('#333')
  drawDino()
  drawHorizon()
  handleLevel(frameCount)
  handleObstacles()
}
```

The if statement above will stop the game from drawing and updating the positions
of our game objects if the game is paused. Lets also make it so that our game can
pause when the **p** key is pressed by updating our keyPressed function.

```js {6-13}
function keyPressed() {
  if ((keyCode === 38 || keyCode === 32) && dino.onGround) {
    dino.jump()
  }

  if (keyCode === 80) {
    if (paused === true) {
      paused = false
    } else {
      paused = true
    }
  }
}
```

<h3 id="collisions">Collisions</h3>

We need a way to check if two game objects are overlapping. To do this, lets
create an overlap function.

```js
function overlap(rect1, rect2) {
  if (
    rect1.x < rect2.x + rect2.width &&
    rect1.x + rect1.width > rect2.x &&
    rect1.y < rect2.y + rect2.height &&
    rect1.y + rect1.height > rect2.y
  ) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

The logic here is a little tricky to understand at first. It compares the boundaries
of two rectangles, and checks if they're overlapping. If they are it returns true,
otherwise it returns false. This method of checking overlap is called [AABB collision
detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection).

We now need to apply our collision detection. One good place to do this is in the **update**
function of our obstacle.

```js {5-9}
 update() {
    this.onScreen = (this.x > -this.width)
    this.x -= this.speed

    const collision = overlap(dino, this)

    if (collision) {
      paused = true
    }
  }
```

<h3 is="types">Obstacle Types</h3>

Lets wrap up this lesson by allowing for the creation of multiple object types. Lets create
a config object under **Obstacle** class to setup up the different type of obstacles we want to spawn.

```js
const obstacleTypes = [
  { color: 'red', width: 50, height: 50 },
  { color: 'yellow', width: 30, height: 50 },
  { color: 'green', width: 30, height: 30 }
]
```

Now, in the createObstacle function, lets make it so that it we pick a random obstacle type
before we create the new obstacle. We also need to randomly pick which type of obstacle we want.

```js {2-5}
function createObstacle() {
  const hardRandom = random()
  const typeIndex = Math.floor(hardRandom * 3)
  const type = obstacleTypes[typeIndex]
  obstacles.push(
    new Obstacle(canvasWidth, type.width, type.height, type.color, 5)
  )
}
```

<h3 id="gameover">Game Over</h3>

Lets wrap up by adding game over logic to our game. Lets add yet another global.

```js {6}
// globals
const canvasWidth = 600
const canvasHeight = 200
let frequency = 0.5
let paused = false
let gameover = false
```

This global needs to be used in our draw.

```js {2-5}
function draw() {
  if (gameover) {
    drawGameover()
    return
  }

  if (paused) return

  background('#333')
  drawDino()
  drawHorizon()
  handleLevel(frameCount)
  handleObstacles()
}
```

The code above will only render the game over screen when our game is over,
otherwise it will draw the full game. We also need to actually set our game
to be over when we register a collision in the update function of our **Obstacle** class.

```js {8}
  update() {
    this.onScreen = (this.x > -this.width)
    this.x -= this.speed

    const collision = overlap(dino, this)

    if (collision) {
      gameover = true
    }
  }
```

We also need to tell our game what to draw when the game is over.
So we'll need to define our **drawGameover** function.

```js
function drawGameover() {
  background('#f')
  textSize(32)
  fill('#fff')
  textAlign(CENTER)
  text('Game Over', canvasWidth / 2, canvasHeight / 2)
  textSize(20)
  text('Press space to try again', canvasWidth / 2, canvasHeight / 2 + 40)
}
```
