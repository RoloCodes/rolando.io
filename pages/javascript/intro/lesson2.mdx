<h3 id="dev-env">Setting Up Your Developer Environment</h3>

For these lessons, we will be using <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a>,
a powerful and simple _integrated developer environment_ (IDE). Not only
can we create our files and write some code and run it, but it also gives us neat
features like auto-complete, code highlighting, and find-replace functions.

  We'll want to start by making an account{' '}
  <a href="https://repl.it/signup">HERE</a>!

  Once you're done, you should be able to see a big blue button at the top of
  the page to let you create a new project.

  The code editor automatically creates the HTML, CSS, and JS files that we
  need, and hooks the all up together for us! Click on the{' '}
  <strong>script.js</strong> file. Moving forward, we want to mainly work with
  the JavaScript file.
