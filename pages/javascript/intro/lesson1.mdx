<h3 id="why">Why programming languages matter?</h3>

Before we start learning JavaScript, we need to understand why we should be
using programming languages in the first place. It is well known that
computers understand **binary** code, similar to the code below:

```bin
00110001 00000000 00000000
00110001 00000001 00000001
00110011 00000001 00000010
01010001 00001011 00000010
00100010 00000010 00001000
01000011 00000001 00000000
01000001 00000001 00000001
00010000 00000010 00000000
01100010 00000000 00000000
```

The first computers actually would represent these binary values using
thousands of tiny lightbulbs with "0" representing the light being off, and
"1" representing the light being on. Improvements in technology has made it so
that we can store and calculate trillions of these zeros and ones within
seconds.

Having a human interact with all those binary numbers is extremely tedious,
time consuming, and error prone. So instead of working directly with the 0's
and 1's, we write instructions for computers using **programing languages**.

So instead of working with the following binary values:

```bin
00001101
10001100101000
01100100 01101111 01100111
01100011 01100001 01110100
```

We can write them in JavaScript as:

```bin
13
9000
"dog"
"cat"
```

<h3 id="history">What is JavaScript?</h3>

JavaScript was created by a company called Netscape back in 1995. It was
originally called _LiveScript_, but the name was later changed to _JavaScript_
to capitalize on the popularity of the quickly growing _Java_ programming
language. This marketing tactic has caused a lot of confusion throughout the
years, leading many to believe that the two languages are related when in
fact, they are not.

JavaScript is primarily used to implement complex behavior on web pages, and
has gone from being a language used to build simple widgets and interactivity
on web pages, to being the foundation of complex and high traffic web
applications such as Google Maps, Amazon, and Netflix. Along with that, many
tools have been built in recent years to allow JavaScript to be used to
program mobile applications, desktop applications, and even small robots!

<h3 id="ecmascript">ECMAScript?</h3>

When it was first released, JavaScript wasn't the only scripting language used
in web browsers. Many browsers competed with each other to become the one
browser to rule them all, in an era known as the browser wars. Along with this
came different scriting languages with varying syntax and ways of interacting with
their respective web browsers.

Theses differences made it so that developers had to either write separate versions
of their applications for each different browser, or to pick only one or two browsers
to run their apps. This lead to a horrible developer and user experience, thus the
creation of _ECMAScript language specification_.

Created by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), the ECMAScript
language specification was used to standardize the languages browsers used.
JavaScript was used as the basis of this specification, and this eventually
led to the wide adoption of JavaScript in almost all web browsers. ECMA regularly
releases updates to ECMAScript which, after a rigorous approval process, eventually
ends up getting impletmented into web browsers as JavaScript.

You'll hear these different versions referenced by different names. ES5 (ECMAScript version 5)
will generally refer to the version of JavaScript used before 2015, and ES6 for
implementations of JavaScript used 2015 and onwards.

#### Summary

- Programming languages let us give computers instructions in a human-readable way
- JavaScript is the most widely used language, and has been adpoted on platforms outside of just web browsers
- ECMAScript is the formal name of the JavaScript language, and is being constantly updated by the people at ECMA.
